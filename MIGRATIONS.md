# TorchLens Migration Policy

## `.tlspec` Compatibility

TorchLens 2.16.0 wrote two public `.tlspec` directory formats:

- Intervention specs with `spec.json` containing `format_version`.
- Portable `ModelLog` bundles with `manifest.json` containing `io_format_version`.

These 2.16.0 formats are permanently readable. TorchLens does not auto-migrate
them in place; readers dispatch by detected format and preserve support for the
legacy schemas.

New writers introduced during the Phase 11 schema graduation emit the unified
manifest format. The polymorphic loader detects the on-disk format and dispatches
to the appropriate reader. During the Phase 11.0 transition, intervention specs
also include `kind: "intervention"` in `manifest.json` while preserving the
2.16.0 fields.

An optional future utility, `torchlens.io.migrate_tlspec(path, dest)`, may write
an upgraded copy in the unified format. It will not be required for loading
existing 2.16.0 files.
