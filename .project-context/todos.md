### Multi-trace V2 (deferred from 2026-04-27 sprint design)

These were scoped OUT of the multi-trace MVP (TraceBundle + TraceOverlay)
but are natural follow-ons. Pick up after MVP ships.

- **Branch-divergence detection.** Soft version of "counterfactual
  tracing." Given a TraceOverlay, surface "branch-divergence nodes"
  where execution paths split, expose as a queryable list. NOT true
  forced-branch enumeration -- just detection of where forward paths
  diverged across the bundled inputs.

- **True counterfactual branch enumeration** (forced-branch execution).
  Programmatically force both arms of every Python `if` in a dynamic
  network. Hard problem -- requires either symbolic tracing
  (incompatible with TorchLens's runtime model), bytecode hacking
  (fragile), or an intervention API where the user explicitly drives
  forced inputs to coax branches. Defer indefinitely; the
  branch-divergence detection above is the practical 80% solution.

- **Streaming aggregate over a dataloader.** `tl.aggregate(model,
  dataloader, metrics=[...])` -- consumes traces from a generator,
  computes running per-node statistics (mean, var, RDM,
  dimensionality), discards raw activations. For "10K images through
  ResNet50" workflows where holding traces is impractical. Function,
  not a class.

- **Interactive viewer for bundles/overlays.** D3.js or anywidget-based
  Jupyter widget. Pan/zoom, hover tooltips, click-to-expand node
  visualizations, path highlighting, export to standalone HTML. After
  graphviz MVP is stable.

- **Custom node visualizations.** Pluggable per-node display: PCA-RGB
  for conv layers, MDS scatter for linear layers, histograms for
  activations, dimensionality estimates. Bundle/Overlay would accept
  `node_display={'conv.*': 'pca_rgb', ...}` mappings.

- **Convenience constructors with intervention APIs.** `tl.zero(node)`,
  `tl.steer(node, vector)`, `tl.compare(model, input, {...})`,
  `tl.sweep(model, input, {...})`. Interventions produce a new
  ModelLog (never mix clean and intervened activations in a Bundle).
  Out of scope for MVP; design once Bundle/Overlay are stable.

- **Rename ModelLog -> Trace** (one-way door). Clean public-API
  migration -- `tl.trace()` constructor, `Trace` class. Major
  breaking change to a published-and-cited package. Do as a separate
  deliberate migration, never bundled with feature work.

- **`vis_opt='rolled'` mode for `show_bundle_graph`.** Phase 2 plumbed
  the kwarg through with arg validation but the bundle renderer
  currently treats every supergraph node as a single rendered node
  regardless. The supergraph already operates on `LayerLog` (rolled-
  equivalent) entries, so cluster titles already carry `(xN)` count
  suffixes for multi-pass modules. A true `rolled` mode would also
  collapse loop-detected layer chains into single rendered nodes the
  way `rendering.py` does for `vis_mode='rolled'`. Defer until a real
  use case appears; the current `unrolled` behaviour covers the
  visualization story for shared-topology and divergent bundles.

- **`direction='backward'` for `show_bundle_graph`.** Currently raises
  `ValueError` on anything except `'forward'`. Backward graph topology
  depends on forward execution path, so multi-trace backward
  visualization needs a design decision -- per-trace separate backward
  subgraphs, or a unified backward supergraph keyed on grad_fn? Defer
  to the multi-trace V2 batch alongside the other Phase 2 follow-ons.

- **Module-type second line in bundle cluster labels.** `show_model_graph`
  cluster labels include a `(<ModuleType>)` line under the module name;
  `show_bundle_graph` omits it because `Supergraph` doesn't preserve
  module class on its nodes. Recoverable in two small edits: add a
  `module_type: str | None` field to `SupergraphNode` populated during
  `build_supergraph` from the canonical trace's `LayerLog.containing_module_type`
  chain, then teach the bundle cluster builder in
  `torchlens/multi_trace/_bundle_clusters.py` to emit the second line
  when present. Defer until aesthetic parity matters more than a clean
  diff.

- **Public `TraceBundle.supergraph` accessor.** The bundle renderer
  reads `bundle._supergraph` privately. If we want users to introspect
  the supergraph directly (e.g. to enumerate selective nodes by their
  edge frequencies, or build custom visualizations), promote to a
  public property. One-line change; defer until a real user asks.

- **Per-node / per-edge styling primitives in `_render_utils.py`.** Phase 2
  polish extracted cluster styling, file-format dispatch, HTML escape,
  and direction translation into shared `_render_utils.py`. Per-node
  styling (`_build_layer_node`, `_build_collapsed_module_node`) and
  per-edge styling were left in `rendering.py` because the shapes
  differ substantially between ModelLog (LayerLog/NodeSpec coupled) and
  bundle (mode-driven coloring) -- agent's call was a parameterised
  version would be thin pass-through or parameter explosion. Revisit if
  a third visualization consumer appears or if the bundle/ModelLog
  styling logic genuinely converges; otherwise the current seam is the
  right one.

### Other improvements

- Rethink the parameter name `activation_postfunc` itself. Current name is
  awkward (`-postfunc` suffix) and the semantic now reads as a "transform"
  hook, not a "post-processing function" (after the raw-vs-transformed
  split landed in PR #166). Candidates: `activation_transform`,
  `activation_hook`, `transform_activation`. Keep `activation_postfunc` as
  a deprecated alias for at least one minor release. Defer to a
  UX-focused naming pass.

- Estimated autograd_saved_bytes via static formula (no graph required).
  Companion to the introspection-based `autograd_saved_bytes` field
  shipped in PR #165: a per-op lookup table keyed on forward function
  name + input/output tensor shapes that returns the expected bytes
  autograd WOULD save if `requires_grad` were on. Useful for what-if
  estimation in `inference_mode` / `no_grad` workflows. Maintenance cost:
  needs PyTorch version pinning + tests for table accuracy across
  releases. Defer until a user actually asks; introspection covers the
  90% case.

- Auto-published model menagerie (replace manual Google Drive). Design
  notes: `.project-context/research/menagerie_revamp.md`. Hybrid CI
  (smoke gallery on PR + full on release) -> GitHub Pages, PDFs as
  release assets, generalize `build_torchlens_theme_gallery.py` as
  template.

- Per-grad_fn auto-computed memory cost. Once GradFnLog has
  saved_for_backward refs from the backward-pass sprint, memory cost per
  grad_fn = sum of saved tensor sizes + output gradient shapes plus
  type-specific contributions. Distinct from the per-op
  `autograd_saved_bytes` shipped in PR #165 -- this is a per-grad_fn
  view (backward-graph node accounting). Currently using explicit
  peak-memory capture per backward sweep. Design notes:
  `.project-context/research/backward_pass_sprint.md` (parking lot).

- Fastlog gradient support (PR C). Predicate-selected gradient capture
  in fastlog. As of 2026-04-27, slow-path backward IS settled (PRs
  #161-163, #165), so this is unblocked architecturally -- gated only
  on JMT direction to dispatch (a research-and-spec sprint). Design
  context: `.project-context/research/backward_pass_sprint.md`. Once
  shipped, fastlog `gradient_postfunc` parity (mirroring slow path
  behavior added in PR #166) becomes the natural followup; do NOT add
  `gradient_postfunc` to fastlog BEFORE gradient capture lands per
  research conclusion in
  `.project-context/research/fastlog_postfunc_parity_2026-04-27.md`.

- Document activation_postfunc / gradient_postfunc portable-save
  persistence story. PR #166 made the callable-drop / repr-keep
  behavior explicit in code, but the user-facing rationale is not
  surfaced in the public docstring or README. Add a short note
  explaining that `torchlens.save` strips the callable for portability
  and retains only `activation_postfunc_repr` /
  `gradient_postfunc_repr` strings as a record. Source: postfunc
  review Finding #7 (`.project-context/research/postfunc_review_2026-04-27.md`).

- Reduce first-call cost of `patch_detached_references()`. Profiling
  audit measured 16.7s cumulative / 8.64s self time on a small smoke
  model -- 70% of total runtime. The cost is one-time (caches across
  calls) but cold-start UX is rough. Options: idempotent re-entry
  guard, narrower `sys.modules` crawl, or an opt-out for environments
  that don't need detached-import patching. Source: profiling audit
  Finding #5 (`.project-context/research/profiling_audit_2026-04-27.md`).

- Bound the AST/file cache for long-running services. Caches in
  `torchlens/postprocess/ast_branches.py` persist by filename and
  aren't bounded. The 50-iteration leak loop confirmed flat behavior
  in normal use (no leak), but daemon-style processes that touch many
  unique source files could accumulate parsed ASTs over time. Add an
  LRU cap and/or a public cache-clear API. Source: profiling audit
  Finding #6.

## Completed (recent)

### 2026-04-27 multi-trace sprint (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

Versions shipped: 2.14.0 (auto-released after Phase 1 merge); Phase 2
release pending semantic-release run on Phase 2 merge (expected 2.15.0).

- PR #170 -> 2.14.0: Phase 1 data layer. New `torchlens/multi_trace/`
  subpackage with `TraceBundle`, `NodeView`, `Supergraph`,
  `compare_topology`, diff metrics (cosine / relative_l2 / pearson +
  scalar L1 fallback). Holds N `ModelLog` instances by reference;
  unified handling of shared-topology and divergent-topology bundles
  (degenerate Overlay model -- one class, not two). 28 tests; ruff +
  mypy + smoke clean.
- PR #171 -> CLOSED (superseded by #172). Initial Phase 2 visualization
  pass shipped working bundle rendering but with judicious duplication
  vs `rendering.py` and simpler module clusters than `show_model_graph`.
  Architect rejected pre-merge.
- PR #172 -> Phase 2 polish + visualization. Three commits on top of
  the closed-#171 state:
  - `refactor(visualization): extract reusable rendering primitives`
    -- pulled cluster styling, file-format dispatch, direction
    translation, HTML escape into `torchlens/visualization/_render_utils.py`;
    adopted in BOTH `rendering.py` AND `elk_layout.py` (genuinely shared,
    not bundle-private).
  - `feat(multi-trace): bundle renderer refactor + module cluster
    aesthetic parity` -- bundle renderer 779 -> 352 LOC (-55%); module
    cluster penwidth/pass-suffix/nesting parity with `show_model_graph`;
    bonus fix for divergence-mode crash on multi-pass canonical nodes.
  - `test(multi-trace): cluster parity tests + defer rolled/backward
    bundle modes` -- 4 cluster-parity regression tests + the two
    deferred-mode todos in this file.
  Single-trace regression tests pass byte-equivalent
  (`test_output_aesthetics`, `test_visualization`,
  `test_backward_visualization`, `test_dagua_theme` all green).

Sprint notes:
- Codex hit daily quota mid-Phase-1 dispatch; pivoted to Claude
  general-purpose subagents for all three dispatches per the
  fallback procedure in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- PR #171 was closed (not merged) after the architect flagged
  insufficient refactoring + missing cluster aesthetic parity. Same
  branch carried forward into PR #172 -- no force-push, three
  commits on top, clean history.

### 2026-04-27 grab-bag + activation_postfunc + perf sprint

Versions shipped: 2.10.0 -> 2.13.0 (six PRs).

- PR #164 -> 2.10.0: `extra_data` + `input_metadata` plumbing on
  LayerLog / LayerPassLog / ModelLog (open-ended user dicts).
- PR #165 -> 2.11.0: `autograd_saved_bytes` per-op introspection
  (distinct from existing `saved_activation_memory` -- autograd's
  saves vs torchlens's own).
- PR #166 -> 2.12.0: `activation_postfunc` raw-vs-transformed split,
  `train_mode` hardening, `ActivationPostfunc` / `GradientPostfunc`
  type aliases, `TorchLensPostfuncError`, README + docstring expansion.
- PR #167 -> 2.12.1: two-pass mode in-place module fix (regression
  source: commit 326b8a90, fast-mode pass-through detector mistakenly
  treating in-place modules as pass-throughs because input labels were
  read AFTER `orig_forward()` already mutated them).
- PR #168 -> 2.12.2: perf bundle, 3-of-3 fixes (bytecode
  column-offset cache, Step 5 branch-attribution fast-skip, CUDA probe
  guard for CPU runs). Shipped via Claude general-purpose agent after
  codex hit daily quota.
- PR #169 -> 2.13.0: fastlog `activation_postfunc` parity. Intentional
  architectural divergence from slow path per
  `.project-context/research/fastlog_postfunc_parity_2026-04-27.md`
  (parallel `transformed_*_payload` fields on `ActivationRecord`,
  postfunc runs in `_storage_resolver` post-predicate, predicates
  still see raw metadata, no `gradient_postfunc` until fastlog gets
  gradient capture). Also via Claude agent.

Research reports committed in `.project-context/research/`:
- `postfunc_review_2026-04-27.md`
- `fastlog_postfunc_parity_2026-04-27.md`
- `profiling_audit_2026-04-27.md`
- `two_pass_diagnostic_2026-04-27.md`

Other artifacts:
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` hardened with a codex-quota-exhaustion
  fallback procedure (added 2026-04-27 incident section under Codex
  Dispatch).
- `.gitignore` extended to ignore `/modelgraph.*` and
  `/backward_modelgraph.*` (default `vis_outpath` filenames that were
  polluting the repo root).
